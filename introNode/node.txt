What is Node?

v8 -- takes JS code and compiles it to much faster machine code.
Managed by Google and is used in Chrombrowser.

Benefits of backend JS -
    Not learn a second or third language.
    Consistency of code base.

runtime - Browser is a runtime. A place where the code is executed.

asynchronous, non-blocking - Multiple users can make requests simultaneously.

event-driven -- driven by events. Event handler + callback.

scalable - works just as well with 10 as 100000 people or files.
Easy to maintain and grow or build an application.

What is Node used for?

-- Backend.
-- Chat apps.
-- Social network.
-- microservices (ex. ONLINESHOP: search function, payment, shopping cart, authentification).
-- CRUD apps - create, read, update, delete.
-- creating servers.

NPM

-- validating objects, creating servers.
-- basically we do not have to spend our time writing utility functions that already exist
-- Difference between Native and Host Objects
    a. Native - (global) - Date, Math, parseInt, arrayMethods
    b. Host - (assuming enviroment) - window, querySelectorAll, document

Process Object - similar to document in browser
